## What is Townvalds
Townvalds is an opensource town plugin for Cuberite. We're aiming to create a fully FOSS town system compatible with Cyberite, comparable to Towny for Bukkit.


## What is Cyberite
Cyberite is a replacement for the Minecraft server, written in C++. It's fully compatible with the official Minecraft clients and is open source. You can compare it with Bukkit and Spigot. Please have a look at their [Github](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite) repo or [website](http://cuberite.org/).
